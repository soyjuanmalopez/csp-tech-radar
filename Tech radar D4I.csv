API First,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"API-first development is a strategy in which the first order of business is to develop an API that puts your target developer’s interests first and then build the product on top of it (be it a website, mobile application, or a SaaS software).

Microservices,hold,techniques,TRUE,Microservices can offer significant advantages to organizations
Testing as a separate team,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Fast feedback is a core tenet of Agile and critical to the success of a project. Using a separate QA team slows down this feedback, creates an ""us and them"" mentality and makes it more difficult to build quality into the software. Testing should be a tightly integrated activity and isn't something the team can outsource. We recommend integrated teams where testers work closely with developers instead of having testing as a separate organization."

Blue / Green Deployments,assess,techniques,FALSE,"Blue-green deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called Blue and Green.""-Ã‚Â cloudfoundry. Could not have said it better myself. Two environments, both production. One might have version 1.0.0 (green) while blue has 1.0.1. Many times traffic is slowly increased to blue while watching for errors or undesirable changes in user behavior. Once all the traffic is moved off from the green (1.0.0) version the environment is shut down. At that point ""blue"" becomes ""green"" and the cycle starts over."
ELK Stack,assess,tools,TRUE,Supporting and developing distributed systems requires the ability to debug events that occur across many systems. Having the logs emitted from each system centralised in a single store that is easily searched is vital for this. The ELK (Elasticsearch

Chaos Engineering,assess,languages & frameworks,true,"In software development, a given software system's ability to tolerate failures while still ensuring adequate quality of service—often generalized as resiliency—is typically specified as a requirement. However, development teams often fail to meet this requirement due to factors such as short deadlines or lack of knowledge of the field. Chaos engineering is a technique to meet the resilience requirement.
Pact Foundation,trial,tools,false,"Pact is a code-first tool for testing HTTP and message integrations using contract tests. Contract tests assert that inter-application messages conform to a shared understanding that is documented in a contract. Without contract testing, the only way to ensure that applications will work correctly together is by using expensive and brittle integration tests."
