Semantic Versioning,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Correctly versioning software that makes sense to everyone using it isn't easy. Using a mature versioning scheme like <a href=""https://semver.org/"">Semantic Versioning</a> helps you version your software service APIs in a way that allows consumers of your service to easily understand the severity of the changes in the new version. It is important to remember that a corresponding git tag of the version should be applied to the commit in the VCS that the versioned artifact was built from."
Pipelines as Code,adopt,techniques,TRUE,Pipelines as code is defining the build and deployment pipeline declaratively through code instead of configuring it in a specific CI/CD tooling - Terraform.
Pair Programming,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming"">Pair Programming</a> is an Agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at some kind of shared workstation setup. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. We believe that although this may seem as an inefficient usage of our developers' time, the quality of the code produced leads to less time consuming problems later. Other benefits include improved knowledge and skills sharing and team communication."
Lightweight Architecture Decision Records,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of evolutionary architecture, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Lightweight <a href=""http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions"">Architecture Decision Records</a> is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We recommend storing these details in <a href=""https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools"">source control</a>, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself. For most projects, we see no reason why you wouldn't want to use this technique."

Microservices Envy,hold,techniques,TRUE,Microservices can offer significant advantages to organizations
Testing as a separate team,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Fast feedback is a core tenet of Agile and critical to the success of a project. Using a separate QA team slows down this feedback, creates an ""us and them"" mentality and makes it more difficult to build quality into the software. Testing should be a tightly integrated activity and isn't something the team can outsource. We recommend integrated teams where testers work closely with developers instead of having testing as a separate organization."

Blue / Green Deployments,assess,techniques,FALSE,"Blue-green deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called Blue and Green.""-Â cloudfoundry. Could not have said it better myself. Two environments, both production. One might have version 1.0.0 (green) while blue has 1.0.1. Many times traffic is slowly increased to blue while watching for errors or undesirable changes in user behavior. Once all the traffic is moved off from the green (1.0.0) version the environment is shut down. At that point ""blue"" becomes ""green"" and the cycle starts over."
ELK Stack,assess,tools,TRUE,Supporting and developing distributed systems requires the ability to debug events that occur across many systems. Having the logs emitted from each system centralised in a single store that is easily searched is vital for this. The ELK (Elasticsearch

Almost sounds too good to be true, which is why we would like to assess this for now.

Kotlin,assess,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href=""http://kotlinlang.org/"">Kotlin</a> has experienced an accelerated rate of adoption and rapid growth of tooling support. Some of the reasons behind its popularity are its concise syntax, null safety, ease of transition from Java and interoperability with other JVM-based languages in general, and that it doubles as a great introductory language to functional programming. With JetBrains adding the ability to compile Kotlin to native binaries on multiple platforms, as well as transpile to JavaScript, we believe it has the potential of much wider use by the larger community of mobile and native application developers. Some of the tooling such as static and coverage code analysis have yet to mature, but given the industry adoption of Kotlin in many production applications, we believe Kotlin should be assessed in our department."
